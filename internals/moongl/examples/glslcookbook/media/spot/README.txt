This archive contains a description of the surface "Spot," including:

1. the original Catmull-Clark control mesh [spot_control_mesh.obj]
2. the original texture map as a vector image [spot_texture.svg]
3. triangular and quadrilateral tessellations [spot_triangulated.obj, spot_quadrangulated.obj]
4. the texture map as a raster image [spot_texture.png]

Note that (3) and (4) can be generated from (1) and (2), and are provided only
for convenience.  Meshes are stored in the Wavefront OBJ format.  All meshes
are manifold, genus-0 embeddings.  The texture map should be interpreted as a
unit square in the positive quadrant [0,1]x[0,1].

## GLSL Cookbook

This is a Lua port of the C++ examples from David Wolff's
[**OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook, 3rd Edition**](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenGL-4-Shading-Language-Cookbook-Third-Edition)
(Packt Publishing).

All shaders, textures, and models used in these examples are taken from the original, and the respective original licenses apply.

The following libraries from the [MoonLibs](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs) collection are used here:

* [MoonGL](https://github.com/stetre/moongl): bindings to the OpenGL API.
* [MoonGLFW](https://github.com/stetre/moonglfw): bindings to GLFW, for window/surface creation and input handling.
* [MoonGLMATH](https://github.com/stetre/moonglmath): graphics math library, for vertex transformations.
* [MoonImage](https://github.com/stetre/moonimage): bindings to stb_image, for image loading.
